## Enabling writing to flash on arduino at runtime.
This is not intended, but I want to learn how to do it.
1. Figure out how to address flash memory at runtime.
2. Figure out if possible to write to flash at runtime.
3. Since I know it is not possible to write at runtime, figure out how to rewrite the firmware to be able to write code there.
4. Rewrite the firmware
5. Profit
